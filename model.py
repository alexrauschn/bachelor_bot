# use NLTK to process input
# => Good URL on how to use NLTK to process strings
# => https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8897593/how-to-compute-the-similarity-between-two-text-documents

# pass this pre-processed input to a quantification function

# count matches between input and patterns
# => potentially just use a dict instead of tensorflow? see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47992091/how-to-match-the-keywords-in-paragraph-using-python-nltk/47992508
# => tutorial on how to use the respective indicators:
# => https://bommaritollc.com/2014/06/30/advanced-approximate-sentence-matching-python/

# find good algorithm: percentage of patterns matched? total count?
# => when counting matches by hand, either only count unique matches OR weigh matches with longer strings more
# example: query is "kann ich mit 4 freunden drauÃŸen sitzen?", and the tag "outdoor" has that exact question. that would yield only ONE point otherwise
# it might even come so that "freunde" and "sitzen" are individual items for the tag "indoors" - yielding two points and associating the query with
# that category! so either for matches, only tokenize unique matches (full phrases match the longest match, not single words from it as well)
# or weigh them by length. or both! experiment with what works best...
# maybe: transform everything into lists; then just get unique list entries, then just compare list contents
# convert array to lists: https://www.journaldev.com/32797/python-convert-numpy-array-to-list

# STEP 1: tokenize the INTENTS via NLTK
# this already happened. the resulting list without duplicates is "classes"
# STEP 2: tokenize the INPUT via NLTK
# STEP 3: create multi dimensional lists
# STEP 4: compare these lists
# STEP 5: save the matching scores

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48598222/appending-items-to-a-list-and-ensuring-unique-name-by-incrementing-number
# possible do this via a list of lists, yes (with answers at position 3 (= 2) in the rows (= [2][0])
# append each new list to the list of lists, the superlist contains all the lists
# the sublists contain the tag (= category) in row 1, the key words in row 2, and the reply in row 3
# compare list [n][1] to the input after tokenization => GOOGLE HOW TO DO THAT
# SAVE the resulting match percentage in the list of lists; it contains to values: the position of the list and the match
# the match percentage is then compared; the one with the highest "wins" and its corresponding position number
# is used to go to the respective list and get the reply from position ([0][n])[2][0]
# find highest value of a list: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_max.htm
# could just save the position of that in a respective temp variable then, use this to
# what if two values are the same?
# percentage-wise match? would punish many key words... (a list with just one generic word would always win)
# absolute match? punish few key words... (a list with tons of words would always win)
# WEIGH BOTH THE SAME
# better idea:
# go through every category and count the matching words (absolute number). save that number as "number 1"
# now divide that number by the amount of items in each category - this gives the percentage wise match. save that number as "number 2".
# compare every number 1 to one another. the category with the highest score is in place 1, the category with the second most matches is place 2...
# save that resulting placement as "placement 1" for every category
# now just compare the scoring with regards to "number 2". again reward placements for every category and save them as "placement 2"
# for every category, add the value of placement 1 + value of placement 2 into the new variable "placement 3", then divide this by two
# this is a ranking that weighs both counting methods equally
# return the reply of the category with the lowest placement 3 score

# get number of elements in list: https://stackabuse.com/python-get-number-of-elements-in-a-list/
# get number of matching elements between two lists: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-count-of-matching-elements-among-lists-including-duplicates/
# divide number of matches by the number of words in tag-list. this varies between 0 and 1 (nothing and everything)
# total number of matches and percentage wise match should both count for 50%
# both should have the same RANGE, but ACROSS categories

# -use 3 dimensional lists: dimension 1 (category), dimension 2 (loooots of key words), dimension 3 (reply) => give item [2][0] as reply, use category [0][0] as category, and [1][n] for key words (while in...)
# -convert every single word into a list item of its own
# -ignore puntucation and ()"' and so on
# -convert the list to lowercase
# -filter out duplicates
# -order the list alphabetically
# -do the same for the input
# -match lists percentage-wise
# -weigh longer strings for higher percentage
# -algorithm: number of characters of each matching word gets counted

# add points for respective tag whenever it matches (see line above - find a good way to quantify a good fit)

# at the end: list categories with most points
# => optional: point threshold?

# give list with best matches
